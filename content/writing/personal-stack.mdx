These are the tools that supercharge my productivity:

**<a href="https://oschat.ai?ref=ajanraj.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oschat.ai</a>** - My goto place to access all the models.

**Helium** - Minimal browser based on Chromium, faster than Zen/Arc.

**Raycast** - Spotlight on steroids. Basically replaced a lot of my apps with this one.

**Zed Editor** - My favorite editor. Runs fast, doesn't take a lot of memory like VSCode.

**Notion** - Favorite note-taking app and collab with people.

**Ghostty** - Blazing fast terminal. GPU accelerated and just works.

**Codex CLI** - Basically my in-house high IQ pair programmer.
